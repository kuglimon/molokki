# Star Wars - Knights of the Old Republic Mod

__Project is mostly educational, expect nothing to work__

Attempt at modding swkotor 1.

Aims to be easier to use. Existing mods rely on patching executables, which
doesn't work for the Steam version - you'd have to sail the seven seas for the
exucutable. Functionality inspired by
[sfall](https://github.com/sfall-team/sfall).

# Current state

Expect nothing to work. I'm just tinkering and learning at this point.

# Wanted features

* Fix crashing after chained cut scenes
* Fix widescreen
* Provide a way for other mods to use this as a framework
